# Missions and Enhancements

To add missions or enhancements you need to add the `object` to its array in the file `constants.ts` in the folder `game`.

```
└── src
    └── game
        └── constant.ts
```

Those new missions and enhancements need to follow the rules or the tests will fail on push. To check if you are applying all the tests you can have them running while working. So, thanks to vitest, every time you save will test if everything is alright.

```sh
npm run test
```

## Missions

All new missions should have the following structure:
```js
    {
        id: "" /*should be unique*/,
        name: "" /*short and descriptive*/,
        description: "" /*relevant, fun details*/,
        goal: 0 /*the higher, the harder the mission is*/,
        reward: {
            type: "" /*what variable updates*/,
            value: 0 /*how much does update it updates*/
        }
    }
```
